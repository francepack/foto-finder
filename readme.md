# Fotofinder
FotoFinder is an individual project that served as the final for Mod 1 of Turing school. We were asked to make a photo sharing website based on a given comp. To do this, we used needed to use local storage to save instances of photos in an array. We faced challenges such as making these photo cards searchable and sortable by their favorite status.

##What I gained
This project challenged me to work on my own to break down JS logic and functionality. While I had success finding a way to make a photo a 'favorite' and have that status save to local storage, and additionally be able to filter the photos by this status, I was frustrated that I struggled to make editable fields save to storage and stay edited on reload. I feel one more day of consulting peers would have gotten me there, but this project was a tough lesson in time management, and prioritizing tasks. While I did not accomplish everything I set out to, I feel pretty good about some of the functionality I did achieve. Like all my projects thus far that have helped me learn, grow as a coder, and show me the next steps to further improvement, I hope to be able to come back to this to improve and edit out my expressed regrets in my readme.
